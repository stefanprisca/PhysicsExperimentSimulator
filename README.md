PhysicsExperimentSimulator
==========================
Welcome to the Physics Experiment Simulator!
This software was developed to allow simulation of physics experiments
based entirely on equations!
Following some simple rules, like putting variables in '{}', you can write
your own experiments and run them to see results for different variable values. Also, you	have all methods from java.lang.Math at your disposal to ease computations, and results are displayed in clear decimal form.

<h1>Building the project</h1>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Make sure you have Code Recommenders 2.x and Xtend installed in your Eclipse IDE</li>
<li>Open and run the simulator.product file from the ro.stefanprisca.physics.experiment.simulator.rcp project</li>
<li>You can also export the project as an executable from the simulator.product file. See <http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseProductDeployment/article.html#deployproduct_overview> for details</li>
</ol>
