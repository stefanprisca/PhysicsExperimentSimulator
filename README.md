PhysicsExperimentSimulator
==========================
Welcome to the Physics Experiment Simulator!
This software was developed to allow simulation of physics experiments
based entirely on equations!
Following some simple rules, like putting variables in '{}', you can write
your own experiments and run them to see results for different variable values. Also, you	have all methods from java.lang.Math at your disposal to ease computations, and results are displayed in clear decimal form.

<h1>Building the project</h1>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Make sure you have Code Recommenders 2.x and Xtend installed in your Eclipse IDE</li>
<li>Open and run the simulator.product file from the ro.stefanprisca.physics.experiment.simulator.rcp project</li>
<li>You can also export the project as an executable from the simulator.product file. See <a href ="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseProductDeployment/article.html#deployproduct_overview">exporting from a product file</a> for details</li>
</ol>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>
In oder to get started with the simulator, first you need to download
the experiments from the repository.
(If you already downloaded them, or you don't want to, skip this step).
</p>

<p>
Next, you'll have to go to File -> Preferences -> Simulator Preferences
and set the experiment directory.
Here you can create a new directory in which to store experiments, or
select the downloaded folder.
Note that you can only change the directory from here. All experiments
created will be saved in the selected dir.
</p>
<p>
After selecting the directory, you will have to re-index the experiments
from the view, this will make them
appear in the list.
</p>
<div>There is also a nice welcome page and a help section that will explain more about getting started.</div>
