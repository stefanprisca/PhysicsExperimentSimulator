<h1>Storing Experiments</h1>
<p>Experiments are stored in json files. This file type has been chosen due to its simple logic
and the ease with which it can be serialized and deserialized.
</p>

<p>
    All experiment files are taken from a user defined folder.
    In order to set this folder, go to <strong>File -> Preferences -> Simulator Pref</strong>
    and set the <strong>Directory</strong> path to the desired folder. <br>
