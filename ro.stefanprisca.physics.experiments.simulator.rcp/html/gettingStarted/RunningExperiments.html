        <h1>Running Experiments</h1>
        After having the experiments displayed in the list and double clicking on
        one, you can run them. <br>
        <p>
            There are two ways of running an experiment:<br>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A single time</li>
            <li>For a period T <br>(Here you need to provide the period in the field below)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>View the results</h2>
        <p>
            In order to view the results you need to open the <strong>Results</strong>
            console.<br>
            This can be done from the console view, in the following way:
            from the bottom right corner select <strong>Open Console -> Results</strong><br>
            <img width="800" height="600" alt="Console View" src="ConsoleView.png">
            <br>
            If there are problems at runtime, this will appear in the <strong>Problems View</strong>
        </p>
        
    </body>
