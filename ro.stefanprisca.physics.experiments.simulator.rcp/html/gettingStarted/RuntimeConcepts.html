            These are some things that you need to keep in mind when editing and
            running experiments using this software:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Equations are computed in the order that they are written!
                The result of the last equation is considered to be the result of the
                experiment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Experiment variables are marked with surrounding '{}'. e.g.:'{a}'<br>
                \t <strong>Note:</strong> if you do not surround the variables with '{}' than the 
                parser will not know how to compute them.
            </li>
            <li>
                The next special variables are pre-defined:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>{PI}</li>
                    <li>{E}</li>
                    <li>{G}</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                Some more variables will be defined in the next releases
                (e.g.: light-speed, sound-speed, density of different materials, etc)
            </li>
            <li>
                All variables used in the equations must also be declared in the variable section!<br>
                The equation editor will ensure there are no undeclared variables and will ask if you want to add
                the undeclared ones. It is <strong>highly</strong> recommended to do so!
            </li>
            <li>
                You can use methods from java.lang.Math class to compute your experiments. <br>
                There is a button in the equation editor dialog that allows you to look through this methods.<br>
                \t <strong>Note:</strong> After inserting a method through the dialog, you need to complete the variable fields!
            </li>
            <li>
                Numbers used in equation <strong>MUST</strong> be in decimal form! e.g.: 2.0 and <strong>NOT</strong> 2<br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Beside the above, there is not much to say. Keep in mind that the software may still be buggy.
