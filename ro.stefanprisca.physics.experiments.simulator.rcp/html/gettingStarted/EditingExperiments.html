        <p>
            In order to edit experiments, select one from the list and press the edit button. At this point, 
            the experiment editor will pop up in the editor area. <br>
            This editor allows you to edit every field of the experiment. In order to modify equations and variables, there are 
            two expanding sections in the right part of the editor.<br>
            <strong>
                When editing equations and variables keep in mind the points presented in the 
                <a href="RuntimeConcepts.html">Runtime Concepts</a> section.
            </strong>
            There are the <i>Move Eq Up</i> and <i>Move Eq Down</i> buttons which allow you to order 
            equations in the desired way.
